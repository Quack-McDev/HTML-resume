        <h1>Some of the things I do in my Freetime</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <p>
            I post progress on my coding Journey through X (Twitter) to keep myself accountable and moving.
        </p>
        <h2>Youtube</h2>
        <p>I use youtube as a platform to post my editing projects when I have the time to do them :p</p>
        
        <h2>Tabletop RPGs</h2>
        <p>I love TableTop Roleplaying Games, I've played <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/">Call of Cthulu</a>, looking to reach into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade">Vampire the Masquerade</a> soon. My main TTRPG of choice is <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. I have been playing dnd for about five years now, and I DM through DMs Guild ZA at the moment to get others into the hobbie</p>
        
        <h2>Youtube Channel Manager</h2>
        <p> I edit and upload videos for a youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYug8wacy5x64gGoyZbAaMQ">Failing Grade</a>.</p>
        <h2>Writer</h2>
        <p>I quite enjoy writing, though I have yet to publish any of my work, but I hope to see my wriitng on shelves one day.</p>
